# WEB

The web (or) www (world wide web) is **<mark>a huge network of connected computer systems</mark>**. In **<mark>1989</mark>**, the world wide web was **<mark>invented</mark>** by sir **<mark>Tim Berners - Lee</mark>**. He was trying to find a new way to easily share data, with the scientists. **<mark>He also made the world's first web browser and a web server</mark>**. He used three technologies for rendering and transferring data in his tech-stack that are HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language), URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP (Hyper Text Transferring Protocol).

## Importance of WEB

* The world is now, can **<mark>connected</mark> via the web**, and can **<mark>exchange</mark> <mark>services</mark>** from finance, entertainment, Govt. & Education domains at fingertips.
    
* Can be **<mark>accessible</mark> to anyone, anywhere & anytime.**
    
* Like this blog, **<mark>different people can get the right information with ease</mark>**.
    
* The problem of **<mark>the</mark>** **<mark>lack of time</mark>** and **<mark>the lack of money</mark>** for people to complete a task, especially government work, most of the work is **<mark>implemented easily and quickly through specialized websites</mark>** like [https://ineuron.ai/](https://ineuron.ai/) and [https://hashnode.com/](https://hashnode.com/)
    
* For example. **<mark>e-shopping</mark>** sites like Flipkart, Amazon, eBay etc., where people can purchase anything, and **<mark>e-educational sites</mark>** like [https://ineuron.ai/](https://ineuron.ai/) people can skill themselves affordably so **<mark>people can purchase anything they need from anywhere in the world through these websites</mark>**.
    
* It also facilitated the individuals who wish to complete their educational journey by doing this through **<mark>distance learning</mark>** communication with the university to which the student has joined.
    
* **<mark>Youtube, Netflix, Amazon prime, </mark> etc., provide different kinds of video and audio entertainment.** People can **watch television channels**, **play entertaining and useful games, watch movies, read books, watch cartoons, watch videos** & so on.
    
* Some websites can **<mark>use to start private businesses</mark>** that generate a **<mark>good income for individuals leading to financial independence</mark>** like [https://ineuron.ai/](https://ineuron.ai/) they provide people to be affiliated through their program [https://affiliate.ineuron.ai/](https://affiliate.ineuron.ai/) to earn money.
    

## Building Block of Web

The web has **<mark>4 supporting pillars or Building blocks</mark>** they are:

### Content :

* It means, the various types of data, and information that is available over the internet are known as Content. Anything we can see on the internet is content.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671775893298/a457ff04-db4c-4833-955c-21e7f35d1542.png align="left")
    

### Client & Server :

* The client request, the data & server sends the required information to the client through server response.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671780326096/33440308-ebcb-4b90-95ed-67d648aab8f1.png align="center")

* Any device through which we **<mark>request</mark>** information <mark>from the server is a client</mark>.
    

### Protocol

* To set up a secure connection and communication between the client and server we use protocols. Protocols are just a bunch or set of rules which deal with information security.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671789043794/a411db0e-d709-4046-85a4-0ee6ca0d8435.png align="center")

* To **<mark>prevent data from corrupting/stealing/leaking</mark>** for this we need to **<mark>convert the data to some format</mark>** so that only the client and server can understand - no other device or human.
    
* **<mark>Converting plain data to an ununderstandable form is called encryption</mark>**. Once the encrypted data reaches the receiver (it's a server), it needs **<mark>to convert back to normal/plain form to make sense of it. This reverse conversion is called decryption</mark>**.

Here is how the communication happens securely between browser and server.

###### 243 is just a **<mark>random number generated by the client</mark>**, we call it a session key **<mark>or symmetric key</mark>**. In the real world, this key is a big string.

### Identifications :

It means **verifying the client** very well before the **<mark>precious data</mark>**. The value of our **<mark>data on banking sites, and social media</mark>** is not less than **<mark>millions of dollars</mark>**. Hence it is a very strong need that every request must be verified. In the world of the internet, this process is divided into 2 - **<mark>Authentication &amp; Authorization</mark>**.

## How does the browser work?

* So we will focus on 2 things here:

### The architecture of Web Browser :

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671863005459/42929aca-1063-4fad-bac6-da5c5fcf1e38.png align="center")

Visual elements of the browser with which user interacts. ie, Address bar, home button, next or previous buttons, bookmarks bar.

### Rendering Engine

* As the name implies, it effectively renders everything for you on a web page.
    

pictures, JSON, XML, video, audio, etc.

### Browser Engine

A bridge between the user interface and the rendering engine. It queries and handles the rendering engine as per the inputs received from the user interface

### **Networking UI Backend**

A web page is a mixture of images, videos, CSS files, and javascript files. All such content exists on some servers.

Networking means fetching the required data/files securely.

#### JavaScript Interpreter

Parse and executes the JavaScript code.

### **Networking UI Backend**

Does the math for all the elements - height, the width of elements than its children etc. - This is called **layouting in the browser**.

Once the layout is done, then it draws the elements pixel by pixel with specified colors. - This is called **painting in the browser**.

### **Data Persistence**

A browser stores various types of data locally.

i.e Cookies. (just delete it from a website you are signed in & you will be signed out) Image / CSS / JavaScript files etc. This speedup up the page rendering.

#### **How does rendering work?**

This is one of the most interesting processes each browser performs when it receives the HTML content from the server.

##### **Let's start with the most obvious way of using the internet** :

You visit a website like [https://ineuron.ai/](https://ineuron.ai/)

The moment you enter this address in your browser and you hit ENTER, a lot of

different things happen:

* The URL gets resolved
    
* A Request is sent to the server of the website
    
* The response of the server is parsed
    
* The page is rendered and displayed

Every single step could be split up into multiple other steps, but for a good.
