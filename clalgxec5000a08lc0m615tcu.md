Hola! Coders 👨‍💻 Hope you all are doing good, In this article I'm going to tell about the similarities in HTML and Prof. Albus Dumbledore, yeah agree it sounds "interesting" how HTML can be compare with Prof. Dumbledore but yes, that's possible because it's the magical world or hogwart's of Web Development. So, let us begin.

# Headmaster

### overview

In the novel written by *J. K Rowling*  **"The Harry Potter"** series there is a character named as Prof. Albus Dumbledore who give **structural support** to the magical wizard world, Hogwart's : The school of magic, Wizard Parliament and Students. He is responsible for the **proper structuring**, **strength**, **power** and having **secret magical abilities**.

HTML is the **"The God Father"** or the character we know as **Don Vito Corleone** of WEB, which is another fictional character played by Mr. Marlon Brando which is based on the novel "The God Father" written by *Mario Puzo* as I already wrote a blog article how HTML rules over the WEB just like **the God Father** please do check out this like :  [The God Father of WEB: Secret Sauce behind Websites]( https://arpitdubey.hashnode.dev/god-father-of-web-secret-sauce-behind-websites )

### HTML and Prof. Albus Dumbledore

It is extremely interesting for me to know how Prof. Albus Dumbledore and **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage (HTML) have some similarities.

![albus-dumbledore-talking-about-happiness-c5bnj723fiuszbe5.gif](https://i.imgur.com/RqE350q.gif align="left")

 Prof. Albus Dumbledore is the one who have these Qualities :

**1.  Leadership :** Professor are the **Building Block** behind every student who want to learn magic!
A good leader provides a **proper structure** and base to their followers. Here in Hogwarts when students loses their self confidence Prof. Dumbledore helps them to regain it.

**HTML** is also the **Building Block** behind the WEB and most of the websites present over the internet. We can say that most of the Web technologies are dependent on HTML it reflects **HTML leads most of the Web technologies as a Leader**. It also provides a **Proper Structure** to other technologies to such are** CSS, JAVASCRIPT**, etc., These three are enough to rule over the internet and HTML leads them. 

> **Note : **Without HTML CSS, JavaScript and other web technologies became useless because every technologies has to be linked, either as a script or component, library, module etc.,

**2. Power :** Prof. Albus Dumbledore is one of the powerful character of the novel and he is **able to perform magic without reciting any magical spell or he knows wand less magic**. These secret qualities makes him interesting, powerful, spooky and unique. He is also the most prominent character all the Hogward's staff, professors,students depend upon him even he is well known magician so in wizard parliament he has great connection and respect to the senators. 

**HTML** is also a powerful language in which other web technologies has to be dependent In my previous blog I called HTML as **The God Father Of WEB** you can read that from here : [The God Father of WEB: Secret Sauce behind Websites]( https://arpitdubey.hashnode.dev/god-father-of-web-secret-sauce-behind-websites ) Still Flutter has less dependencies over the WEB world and HTML is powerful enough to lead it.

Here we have small example of HTML power.

A Input Suggestion, even we can create a input suggestion box this show we can provide smartness to HTML too.

Also, **you can perform magic ! without using magical spells and without using your magical wand**

If you want to know how magic makes HTML more powerful you can check out one more blog of mine : [Magic that makes HTML more Handsome](https://arpitdubey.hashnode.dev/magic-that-makes-html-more-handsome)

After reading the above two blogs I can say this to my mom : 
![html_power.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668711303178/qffN1MApJ.png align="left")

**3. Can Perform Magic rituals without Mark, Magical Spells and Magical Wand :**
As, Prof. Albus Dumbledore is the powerful character he is able to perform **MAGIC** without Using Mark (**Inline CSS**), Magical spells (**Internal CSS**) and without Magical Wand (**External CSS**).

**HTML** can also perform Magic, yes it can do Beautify also let's see how

I made a simple web page which looks pretty good I can say and I also provide it's code in code pen IDE. See I know CSS gives it much better looks and can able to do much more advance things but I just want to show HTML can do it too.
